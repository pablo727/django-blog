19-1. Blog: Start a new Django project called Blog. Create an app called 
blogs, with one model that represents an overall blog, and one model that 
represents an individual blog post. Give each model an appropriate set of fields. 
Create a superuser for the project, and use the admin site to make a blog and 
a couple of short posts. Make a home page that shows all posts in an 
appropriate order.
Create pages for making a blog, for making new posts, and for editing 
existing posts. Use your pages to make sure they work.
